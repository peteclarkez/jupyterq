The instructions below are for building your own Docker image. A prebuilt Docker image is available on Docker Cloud, if you only want to run the jupyterq image then install Docker and [read the instructions on the main page](../README.md#docker) on how to do this.

## Preflight

You will need [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) on your workstation; make sure it is a recent version.

Check out a copy of the project with:

    git clone https://github.com/KxSystems/jupyterq.git

## Building

To build the project locally you run:

    docker build -t jupyterq -f docker/Dockerfile .

Once built, you should have a local `jupyterq` image, you can run the following to use it:


	docker run -it -p 8888:8888 jupyterq


The above command will populate the root folder `/jqnotebooks` with the example notebooks.

If you wish to use your own notebooks you can use something along the lines of the following to set the volume.

To mount the current folder On windows run 

	docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v %cd%:/jqnotebooks jupyterq 
		
On Mac / Linux	run  

	docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v $pwd:/jqnotebooks jupyterq

There is also a volume at `/jqdata` which can be used to mount data into the container.			
		
**N.B.** if you wish to use an alternative source for [embedPy](https://github.com/KxSystems/embedPy) then you can append `--build-arg embedpy_img=embedpy` to your argument list.

Other build arguments are supported and you should browse the `Dockerfile` to see what they are.

# Deploy

[travisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) is configured to monitor when tags of the format `/^[0-9]+\./` are added to the [GitHub hosted project](https://github.com/KxSystems/jupyterq), a corresponding Docker image is generated and made available on [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/)

This is all done server side as the resulting image is large.

To do a deploy, you simply tag and push your releases as usual:

    git push
    git tag 0.7
    git push --tag
