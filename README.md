# jupyterq
Jupyter kernel for kdb+. Features include

- Syntax Highlighting for q
- Code completion for q keywords, .z/.h/.Q/.j namespace functions, and user defined variables
- Code help for q keywords and basic help (display and type information) for user defined objects
- script like execution of code (mulitline input)
- Inline display of charts created using embedPy and matplotlib
- console stdout/stderr capture and display in notebooks
- Inline loading and saving of scripts into and from notebook cells


## Requirements
- kdb+>= v3.5 64-bit
- Python >= 3.5
- [embedPy](https://github.com/KxSystems/embedPy)

## Overview

You can either

*   Install jupyterq to run on your local machine; or
*   Download or build a Docker image in which to run jupyterq

There are two ways to install jupyterq on your local machine:

1.  Download and install a release

1.  Install with Conda - recommended if you are already using Anaconda Python

## Install on local machine

### Download and install a release

1. Make sure you have installed [embedPy](https://github.com/KxSystems/embedPy)

1. Download a release archive from the [releases](../../releases/latest) page, and unzip it.

1. Install the required Python packages with

   pip

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   or with conda

   ```bash
   conda install --file requirements.txt
   ```


1. Ensure QHOME is set and you have a working version of q in your PATH, note that jupyter will not pick up bash aliases when starting q, the location of the q executable needs to be in your PATH.

1. Run the install script

    Linux/macOS

    ```bash
      ./install.sh
    ```
    Windows
    ```
     install.bat
    ```

### Install with Conda

1. [Download and install](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html) either the full Anaconda distribution or Miniconda for Python3.

2. Use the `conda` to install jupyterq and it's dependencies

```bash
conda install -c kx jupyterq
```

3. Ensure you can run q *before* running jupyterq for the first time, you may need to generate an on demand licence

```bash
q
...
q)\\
```

## Running after install

To run the jupyter console
```
jupyter console --kernel=qpk
```
To run the example notebook
```
jupyter notebook kdb+Notebooks.ipynb
```

## Run a Docker Image

If you have [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) you can alternatively run:

	docker run -it --name myjupyterq -p 8888:8888  kxsys/jupyterq

Now point your browser at http://localhost:8888/notebooks/kdb%2BNotebooks.ipynb.

The above command will populate the root folder `/jqnotebooks` with the example notebooks.

If you wish to use your own notebooks you can use something along the lines of the following to set the volume.  

To mount the current folder Linux/macOS run

    docker run -it \ 
      --name myjupyterq \
      -p 8888:8888 \
      -v $pwd:/jqnotebooks \
      kxsys/jupyterq

Windows

	docker run -it ^
      --name myjupyterq ^
      -p 8888:8888 ^
      -v %cd%:/jqnotebooks ^
      kxsys/jupyterq

There is also a volume at `/jqdata` which can be used to mount data into the container.			

For subsequent runs, you will not be prompted to redo the license setup when calling:

    docker start -ai myjupyterq

**N.B.** [instructions regarding headless/presets are available](https://github.com/KxSystems/embedPy/blob/master/docker/README.md#headlesspresets)

**N.B.** [build instructions for the image are available](docker/README.md)

## Using notebooks

See the notebook kdb+Notebooks.ipynb for full interactive examples and explanation, it should be viewable on github.
